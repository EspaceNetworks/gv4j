Unofficial Google Voice API for Java created by reverse engineering the Google Voice mobile site.

See the [Wiki](../../wiki) for more details.

## Caveats
Since Google does not provide an official API for Google Voice, the web requests which GV4J relies on could break at anytime and without warning.
